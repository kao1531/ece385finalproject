This was our final project for ECE385. It is a based on the "Fireboy and Watergirl" game, which is a multiplayer game where players must work together to move through the maze while avoiding obstacles.


The top level file for the project is mb_usb_hdmi_top.sv. To run, import the mb_usb_hdmi_top.xsa into Vitis with the same setup as in the workspace folder. When the game is run, it can immediately be played. To reset or play again, press the Enter key on the keyboard.
